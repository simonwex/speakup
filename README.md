SpeakUp!
========

soft spoken developers + remote employees + team meetings == SpeakUp!

What it does
------------

SpeakUp! allows users to visually indicate when they're unable to hear the speaker during meetings.  Just tap/click on 'SpeakUp!' and it'll flash for all viewers of the page.

To Do
-----

* add ability to have different "rooms"
* set maximum number of queued "speakup" events so clicking repeatedly doesn't keep the screen flashing for a long time
